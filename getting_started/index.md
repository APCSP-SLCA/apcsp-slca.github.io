# Getting Started

Lovely walkthrough on installing Python and Pyzo, as well as setting up AP Classroom!

## Python

We will be learning the Python programming language. Python is human-readable and used to teach programming in highschool and college-level courses. Apple computers have Python installed by default to run backwards-compatible maintenance programs; however, this version of Python is old, so we will need to install a newer version ourselves.

## Python Installation

Go to the [python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Click "Download Python 3.x" (make sure that the "x" is a number greater than 7, i.e. 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10)

Once downloaded, double click the .pkg file, and move the expanded "Python 3.x" file to your Applications folder.

## Pyzo

We will be using the Pyzo IDE (**i**ntegrated **d**evelopment **e**nvironement) for this course. For each programming assingment you will download the associated zip file and unzip by double clicking. You will then have access to instructions and any code I provide.

## Pyzo Installation

To install Pyzo on your Mac, click [pyzo-4.12.3-macos_x86_64.dmg](https://github.com/pyzo/pyzo/releases/download/v4.12.3/pyzo-4.12.3-macos_x86_64.dmg){:target="_blank"} to download the package.

Right-click-open the downloaded file. The package installer walks you through installing Pyzo.

After Pyzo is set up, we need to install some Python packages that we'll be using throughout the semester. Python packages will allow us to create animations and use other people's code without re-inventing the wheel multiple times over. *This is a form of collaboration!*

Download, unzip, and open [`setup.py.zip`](https://github.com/APCSP-SLCA/Weekly-Assignments/raw/main/setup.py.zip) in Pyzo.

In Pyzo, click `Run > Run file as script` or press `Shift-Command-E`. If everything went well, the program should list out all the installed packages.
