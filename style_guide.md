# Style Guide for Python

There's no one, right way to stylize code. _But_ there are definitely a lot of wrong (or, at least, bad ways). Even so, I do ask that you adhere to the conventions below so that I can reliably analyze your code's style. I don't grade code style, but it will make your programs more readable -- to yourself and to me.

## Line Length

By convention, the maximum length of a line of code is 80 characters. This helps to avoid having to horizontally scroll!

## Comments

Comments make code more readable, not only for others (e.g., your code buddies, me) but also for you, especially when hours, days, weeks, months, or years pass between writing and reading your own code. Commenting too little is bad. Commenting too much is bad. Where's the sweet spot? Commenting every few lines of code (i.e., interesting blocks) is a decent guideline. Try to write comments that address one or both of these questions:

* What does this block do?
* Why did I implement this block in this way?

## Indentation
In Python, whitespace (e.g., spaces, newlines) is part of your code! It's important to be consistent. Choose an indentation level of either 4 or 2 spaces, and be consistent in indenting that many spaces! Luckily, Pyzo lets you set an indentation level and use the tab key to indent (click `File > Indentation`).

## Pseudocode & Diagrams

I highly recommend to write pseudocode *prior to implementation*! Likewise, I highly recommend diagramming the flow of your program. In fact, I require diagrams and pseudocode for some of your assignments. You will be able to submit a drawing (digital or hand-drawn) when you submit the assignment.

Here is a pseudocode reference sheet, taken directly from the College Board. *Note:* for the exam, you will have access to this reference sheet, so get comfortable with it!
